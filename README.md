The algorithm and implementation of the adjustmentof the servo drives position using real time image processingso called optical feedback.

The goal of the task is to use the available tools and libraries for image processing and Bosch Rexroth servo drive control for precise positioning of the shaft at a given position using the real time camera image. In order to recognize the image frames, their unblurring, and at the same time accurately determine the position of the servo drive, a number of different techniques can be used, among others opencv or artificial neural network.
